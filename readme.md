🎉 Welcome to TypeScript! 🎉
TypeScript is a typed superset of JavaScript that brings static typing to the dynamic world of JavaScript. It adds type safety while keeping all the cool features you love in JavaScript! 🖥️✨

🔑 Why Use TypeScript?
💻 JavaScript + Types: TypeScript allows you to catch errors earlier by adding types to your JavaScript code.
🔍 Type Safety: You can define variables and function arguments with specific types, like string, number, or boolean to avoid unexpected errors.
⚙️ Better Tooling: With TypeScript, you'll get better autocompletion and error checking in your IDE, helping you code faster and more reliably.
🛠️ Easy to Compile: TypeScript code gets compiled into plain JavaScript, so it works everywhere JavaScript runs (browsers, Node.js, etc.) 🌍
