🚀 **Setting Up TypeScript on Your Machine**  
The first step in mastering TypeScript is getting your development environment ready! 🌐 Let’s go through the process of installing and verifying the TypeScript compiler. No worries if you're new to this – we’ll break it down for you step by step! 🛠️

🔧 **Prerequisites**  
Before we start, make sure Node.js is installed on your computer. Why? Because we’ll be using Node Package Manager (NPM), which comes with Node.js, to install TypeScript.

**Check if Node.js is Installed**  
1. Open your terminal (Command Prompt, PowerShell, or a terminal emulator like iTerm).  
2. Run the following command:  
   `node -v`  
   - If you see a version number (e.g., v16.18.0), Node.js is already installed. ✅  
   - If not, visit the [Node.js official website](https://nodejs.org/) and download the latest version for your OS. Install it, then rerun the command to confirm it’s installed.

📥 **Installing the TypeScript Compiler**  
Once Node.js is installed, use npm to install TypeScript. Just follow these steps:

1. Open your terminal and run:  
   `npm i -g typescript`  
   The `-g` flag ensures TypeScript is installed globally, making it accessible from anywhere on your machine. 🌍  
2. This will download and install the TypeScript compiler.  
3. To verify the installation, check the TypeScript version by running:  
   `tsc -v`  
   If you see something like "Version 5.7.2," TypeScript is installed successfully. 🎉

🖥️ **Choosing an IDE**  
For this course, we’ll be using **Visual Studio Code (VS Code)** – a powerful, beginner-friendly IDE. 💻  

1. Download VS Code from the [official website](https://code.visualstudio.com/).  
2. Install and launch it on your computer.

🛠️ **Configuring VS Code for TypeScript**  
1. **Install the TypeScript Extension**  
   - Open VS Code.  
   - Go to the Extensions Marketplace (click the square icon on the left or press `Ctrl+Shift+X`).  
   - Search for and install the "TypeScript Language Features" extension. 🔍

2. **Set Up a New Project**  
   - Create a new folder for your TypeScript projects.  
   - Open the folder in VS Code (File → Open Folder).  
   - Add a new file, e.g., `index.ts` (remember, all TypeScript files use the `.ts` extension).

3. **Compile TypeScript Code**  
   - In the terminal, navigate to your project folder:  
     `cd path/to/your/project`  
   - To compile your TypeScript file, run:  
     `tsc index.ts`  
   This will generate a JavaScript file (`index.js`) that you can execute with Node.js.

📦 **Important Notes on TypeScript Versions**  
- **Version Compatibility**: Don’t worry if the TypeScript version you’re using differs slightly from the one used in this course. 🌟 The core concepts remain the same across versions.  
- Use `tsc -v` anytime to check the installed version of TypeScript.

Now you’re all set up and ready to start coding with TypeScript! 🎉
